# nautyGraphVisualizer
Comp359 final project. Assigned to show what can be done with nauty and then visualize some graphs generated with it. It also displays 3 different properties relating to the nodes of the same graph in different subplots. This is designed to be a plug and play script where you just update the read path to the graph6 file nauty spits out. Everything else related to display is done for you.

You must generate your own g6 graph file using nauty and then update the file path in the code to its location. 

We noticed sharing graph6 files often didn't work due to powershell corrupting them, so please make your own.
